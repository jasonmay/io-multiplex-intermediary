=head1 NAME

IO::Mulltiplex::Intermediary::Client - base controller for the server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Controller;
    use Moose;
    extends 'IO::Multiplex::Intermediary';

    around build_response => sub {
        my $orig = shift;
        my $self = shift;

        my $response = $self->$orig(@_);

        return rot13($response);
    };

    around connect_hook => sub {
        my $orig = shift;
        my $self = shift;
        my $data = shift;

        $players{ $data->{data}{id} } = new_player;

        return $self->$orig(@_);
    };

    around input_hook => sub {
        my $orig = shift;
        my $self = shift;

        return $self->$orig(@_);
    };

    around disconnect_hook => sub {
        my $orig   = shift;
        my $self   = shift;
        my $data   = shift;

        delete $player{ $data->{data}{id} };
        return $self->$orig($data, @_);
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING! THIS MODULE HAS BEEN DEEMED ALPHA BY THE AUTHOR. THE API
MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT VERSIONS.>

The flow of the controller starts when an end connection sends a
command.  The controller figures out who sent the command and relays
it to the logic that reads the command and comes up with a response
(Application).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item C<host>

This attribute is for the host on which the server runs.

=item C<port>

This attribute is for the host on which the server runs on.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<run>

Starts the client, which connects to the intermediary and waits for
input to respond to.

=item C<send($id, $message)>

Tells the intermediary to output C<$message> to the user with the ID
C<$id>.

=back

=head1 HOOKS

These are internal methods with the primary purposes of hooking from
the outside for a more flexible and extensive use.

=over

=item C<build_response>

This hook is a method that you want to hook for doing your response
handling and output manipulateion (see the L</SYNOPSIS> section).  As the
method stands, C<build_response> returns exactly what was input to
the method, making the application a simple echo server.

=item C<connect_hook>

This hook runs after a user connects. It returns JSON data that
tells the intermediary that it has acknowledge the user has
connected.

=item C<input_hook>

This hook runs after the intermediary sends an input request. It
returns a JSON output request which contains the response build by
C<build_response>.

=item C<disconnect_hook>

This hook runs after a user disconnects. It has the same behavior
as the C<connect_hook> method, just with disconnect information.

=item C<tick>

This hook runs on the second every second. By itself, it is does
not do anything. Hooking from other applications is its only purpose.
